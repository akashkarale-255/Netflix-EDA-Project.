# 🎬 Netflix Movies and TV Shows – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project explores the Netflix dataset available on Kaggle, containing details about over 8,800 titles including movies and TV shows.

## 📌 Project Overview

Netflix is one of the world’s largest content streaming platforms. This analysis dives into the composition of its content — what types dominate, how content has evolved over time, top producing countries, and the most common genres.

The goal of this project is to:
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Uncover insights using exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Visualize trends using Python libraries like Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.

## 🔍 Key Findings

- **Movies dominate** the Netflix catalog compared to TV Shows.
- **Content growth spiked** between 2008–2021.
- The **United States**, **India**, and the **UK** are the top contributors in terms of content production.
